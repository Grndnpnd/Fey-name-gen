- Vocabulary replacement systems
- Pattern-based transformation algorithms

**Verification Status**: ✅ Based on verified court characteristics from research files

### ✅ Task 4: Feature Specifications
**Objective**: Create detailed specifications for each website feature

**Files Created**:
- `./data/feature_specifications.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide

**Specifications Include**:
- **Overall Design Requirements**: Color schemes, visual style, technical architecture
- **Feature 1 - Fey Name Generator**: Functional requirements, UI specifications, technical implementation
- **Feature 2 - Dialogue Translator**: Translation capabilities, interface design, processing requirements
- **Feature 3 - Fey Effect Table**: Effect categories, user controls, random generation system
