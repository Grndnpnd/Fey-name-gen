## Research Date: September 16, 2025
## Sources: Verified homebrew and official D&D resources

## Fey Magic Characteristics
- Most effects are temporary (avoiding permanent transformations)
- Effects range from minor cosmetic changes to significant magical disruptions
- Themed around fey and natural magic
- In the Feywild, one-third of all magical effects can potentially fail
- Outsider magic is particularly susceptible to wild magic surges

## Effect Categories

### 1. Beneficial/Good Effects

- **Enhanced Senses**: Ability to sense non-friendly creatures within 120-foot radius for 1 hour
- **Temporary magical manifestations**: Positive magical outcomes
- **Cosmetic enhancements**: Vibrant skin colors and magical appearances

### 2. Neutral Effects
- **Confusion spells**: Temporary disorientation
- **Unexpected magical manifestations**: Fireball appearing as glowing fey light
- **Minor cosmetic changes**: Temporary alterations that can be removed by high-level spells
- **Sensory alterations**: Changes to perception without major impact

### 3. Challenging/Negative Effects

## Wild Magic Surge Characteristics

3. **Negatively affecting hostile creatures**
